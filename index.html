                    <p>Had a great session with Refine Badminton Academy last night. I was playing badminton for leisure previously, this is the first time attending a proper coaching lesson. Coach Danial was very patient in explaining the different techniques from holding the racket to footwork, the session really broadens my perspective about badminton as a sport, there's so much details in every move.</p>

                    <p>Recently did a group class with Refine Badminton Academy. Coach Jacky was not only knowledgeable, but also very patient with players of all skill levels. The drills were well structured and provided a good introduction to the sport, as well as development of fundamental skills to advance further. Will definitely sign up for more classes to improve my skills!</p>

                    <p>I've attended a few sessions with coach Ming Jun and his coaching style is a good mix of theory with practical demonstration. He breaks down complex strokes (e.g., drop shots) into simple, manageable steps that are clear and easy to follow. His patience and genuine kindness in answering my questions also makes each lesson enjoyable and stress-free. I've had a noticeable improvement in my technique and confidence on the court. Totally recommend coach Ming Jun for anyone looking to improve their badminton skills!</p>
